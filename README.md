Next Steps from my perspective:

-Finish percentage change columns

-Run stepwise regression on these variables, report adjusted r-squared and AIC

-Use to predict different tracts, report effectiveness

-Develop conclusions and edit slides


Optional:

-Run ridge or lasso regression to see if these perform better.

-Use time series analysis on some tracts to see trends here
