# 4031Project

Please feel free to edit this - I have my files stored on a different path than Kira does.

Next Steps from my perspective:

-Create all percentage change columns

-Run stepwise regression on these variables, report adjusted r-squared

-Use to predict 2018 prices, analyze effectiveness of model

-Develop conclusions and edit slides


Optional:

-Run ridge or lasso regression to see if these perform better.

-Use time series analysis on some tracts to see trends here
