# 4031Project

Please feel free to edit this - I have my files stored on a different path than Kira does.
Next Steps from my perspective:

-Create all percentage change columns
-Run stepwise regression on these variables, report adjusted r-squared
-Use to predict 2018 prices, analyze effectiveness of model
-Develop conclusions and edit slides

Optional:
-Run ridge or lasso regression to see if these perform better.
-Use time series analysis on some tracts to see trends here
